# 1. Calculates the move velocity.
# 2. Moves the character.
# 3. Updates the sprite direction.
# 4. Updates the animation.

# Splitting the physics process logic into functions not only makes it
# easier to read, it help to change or improve the code later on:
# - If you need to change a calculation, you can use Go To -> Function
#   (Ctrl Alt F) to quickly jump to the corresponding function.
# - If you split the character into a state machine or more advanced pattern,
#   you can easily move individual functions.
